## Summary

This document describes a novel approach to implementing a magic system for tabletop role-playing games (such as Dungeons & Dragons) and fantasy universes using JavaScript as a functional core. The proposed system allows for deep, flexible interaction with the game world by treating magic as executable code with real logic, internal consistency, and the potential for systemic evolution or collapse.

## Core Concept

At the heart of the idea lies the notion of **"magic as code"**: spells and magical effects are defined not by symbolic language or prewritten rules, but by functional JavaScript code executed within a sandboxed environment governed by magical "physics".

- Each **spell is a code snippet** (a function or set of instructions) that interacts with the world.
- The **mana cost** is computed dynamically based on the spell's complexity (e.g., nested logic, recursion, side effects).
- **If the code executes successfully and sufficient mana is available, the spell works** — regardless of its narrative implications.
- Spells can be self-referential or world-altering — e.g., destroying the rules that govern magic itself.

## Features

- **Self-Modifying Magic**: Magic can modify other spells, override laws of physics, or rewrite the structure of the universe.
- **Dynamic Rule System**: Since the entire system is powered by JavaScript, game rules can change at runtime.
- **Cosmic Events as Systemic Failures**: Breaking core magical laws (e.g., overriding the core execution model) can result in world-ending events — a metaphorical "end of times".
- **Reboot by External Scripts**: When the magical universe collapses, external god-like "scripts" (independent, persistent functional entities) can restart the universe, optionally injecting new rules or physics.
- **Spell Economy**: The cost of a spell is not fixed but emergent — the more complex the logic, the more expensive it is to cast.

## Applications

- TTRPG systems (e.g., custom D&D campaigns)
- Narrative-driven digital simulations or MUDs
- AI-assisted game mastering systems
- Procedural lore generation
- Magic systems with programmable APIs

## Philosophical Implications

This system blurs the line between player and developer, spell and function, rule and law. By using JavaScript — a real-world, universal language — it elevates magic from symbolic expression to executable ontology. A mage becomes a developer, and the universe becomes a program that can be hacked, refactored, or deleted.
