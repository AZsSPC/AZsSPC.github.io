# az_spells

**Project Start Date**: January 2, 2025

**az_spells** is a unique visualization project that brings JavaScript to life as magical circles. Originally conceived during the planning of a Dungeons & Dragons campaign, this project reimagines the nature of magic within tabletop roleplaying games. Instead of shouting "FIREBALL!" like a traditional wizard, your character now expresses their magical knowledge through JavaScript â€” the most arcane language of them all.

### ðŸ§™ What is this?

This project transforms JavaScript code into magical glyphs and runic circles, offering a completely new paradigm for how magic can be portrayed in games like D&D. It bridges the gap between code and roleplay, turning spellcasting into a literal act of scripting â€” where the syntax is power and the function is spellcraft.

Rather than relying on static spell lists, players now interact with a dynamic magical system where logic and structure matter. This approach gives depth to character abilities and allows for unprecedented customization and creativity in spellcasting.

### ðŸŒ€ Inspiration

Although similar projects exist â€” such as [mystical_ps by denismm](https://github.com/denismm/mystical_ps), which was published before this one â€” **az_spells** was developed independently. The concept and implementation are original and were not inspired or based on any pre-existing work.

### ðŸš§ Current Status

Actively under development. Expect frequent updates as features are built and refined.
